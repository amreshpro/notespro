# News Feed System

If you are asked to design a news feed system, you want to ask questions that help you clarify the requirements. The conversation between you and the interviewer might look like this:

Candidate: Is this a mobile app? Or a web app? Or both?
Interviewer: Both.

Candidate: What are the most important features for the product?
Interviewer: Ability to make a post and see friends’ news feed.

Candidate: Is the news feed sorted in reverse chronological order or a particular order? The particular order means each post is given a different weight. For instance, posts from your close friends are more important than posts from a group.
Interviewer: To keep things simple, let us assume the feed is sorted by reverse chronological order.

Candidate: How many friends can a user have?
Interviewer: 5000

Candidate: What is the traffic volume?
Interviewer: 10 million daily active users (DAU)

Candidate: Can feed contain images, videos, or just text?
Interviewer: It can contain media files, including both images and videos.

Above are some sample questions that you can ask your interviewer. It is important to understand the requirements and clarify ambiguities

## Do and Don't

## Dos

- Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct.

- Understand the requirements of the problem.

- There is neither the right answer nor the best answer. A solution designed to solve the problems of a young startup is different from that of an established company with millions of users. Make sure you understand the requirements.

- Let the interviewer know what you are thinking. Communicate with your interview.

- Suggest multiple approaches if possible.

- Once you agree with your interviewer on the blueprint, go into details on each component. Design the most critical components first.

- Bounce ideas off the interviewer. A good interviewer works with you as a teammate.

- Never give up.

## Don’ts

- Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions.

- Don’t jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions.

- Don’t go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning. Give the high-level design first then drills down.

- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints.

- Again, communicate. Don't think in silence.

- Don’t think your interview is done once you give the design. You are not done until your interviewer says you are done. Ask for feedback early and often.



## Time  - usually 45 minutes

Step 1 Understand the problem and establish design scope: 3 - 10 minutes

Step 2 Propose high-level design and get buy-in: 10 - 15 minutes

Step 3 Design deep dive: 10 - 25 minutes

Step 4 Wrap: 3 - 5 minutes
